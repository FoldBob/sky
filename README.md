Sky New Zealand channels, ripped straight off the Sky Go server. It works like IPTV channels, i guess you could say.

# How do i use this?
Simple. Use the Shaka player. https://shaka-player-demo.appspot.com/.

# How do i save and play a channel?
It's complicated, but this will get you through the process. Thanks to muv7 for this tutorial.
1. Enter the Shaka website provided and click "custom content".
2. Press the + (add) button.
3. For the Manifest URL, Go to a channel folder in this repo and select the .txt file. Now, copy the Manifest URL provided (example: Manifest: https://manifest.url), then paste it into Shaka.
4. For the name, the channel's name. Can be anything you want though.
5. Go to DRM, then find the DRM URL in the same txt file you used to get the manifest, copy that, then paste it into Shaka.
6. If you are outside of NZ (New Zealand), get a VPN and connect to it's NZ location. I recommend Urban VPN for Chrome, since it's completely free. (If you stop the VPN, the channel will stop working.)
7. You are good to go.
8. Play the channel by clicking "Play".

# How do i record a currently playing channel?
Once followed the steps above, turn off hardware acceleration in Chrome and then relaunch Chrome.
Go to the Shaka player and now you can snap and record free.
The best way to record these channels is to go fullscreen and Window Capture them in OBS.
